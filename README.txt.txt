This is the code for an interpreter of a C-like language originally called Clite. I added some basic OOP concepts into the lexer, parser and typechecker allowing for classes and interfaces.

To run this code you need to compile AbstractSyntax.java and then compile and run either the Lexer.java, the Parser.java, or the StaticTypeChecker.java depending on how much you want to interpret.
